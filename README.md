I don't like people I barely know referring to me by my name, just use the character's name that I'm cosplaying as or just 'dragonspiral' if you have to refer to me

<b>status meanings</b>
<ul>
  <li> â›” <b>do not disturb</b>: I'm online, might be offtab but will probably check back in semi-frequently </li>
  <li> ðŸŒ™ <b>idle</b>: VERY offtab/busy, will probably not respond</li>
  <li> ðŸ’¬ <b>looking for chat</b>: probably attention seeking tbh </li>
</ul>

I have my chatlog on the personal tab 99% of the time if you want me to see your message it's better if you whisper me

usually sitting w my friends or hanging out around pokemon/splatoon/nintendo area, crowns/whispers/boops/compliments whatever are fine. I will just move if I am uncomfortable
